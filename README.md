# PETASUS: Petasus Encapsulates TAlus' Search Utility Scripts

It is also an [ancient Greek hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petasos).
This package is merely a bundle of scripts that we use at least occasionally to after performing a database search with Comet or Sage on DDA proteomics data.
These are written with our data in mind, so your mileage may vary.

## Installation

Petasus requires Python >= 3.10 and is pip installable:
``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/TalusBio/petasus
```

## Usage

Petasus is a command line tool.
Each subcommand performs a different random of task that we've tried to describe adequately for its use.
